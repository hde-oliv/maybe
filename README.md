# Maybe
A shell command inspired by `yes`, instead of only printing `y`, it has a random chance of printing `n`.

## Instalation
You just needs `gcc`, clone the repo and run:
```shell
sudo make install
```
And it's ready to use.

## Todo
- [ ] `--help` flag
- [ ] `--version` flag
- [ ] Take a string as input and maybe print it
