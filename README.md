# Maybe
A shell command inspired by `yes`, instead of only printing `y`, has a random chance of printing `n`.

## Installation
You just need `gcc`, clone the repo and run:
```shell
sudo make install
```
And it's ready to use.

##  Todo
- [x] `--help` flag
- [x] `--version` flag
- [x] Take a string as input and maybe print it
